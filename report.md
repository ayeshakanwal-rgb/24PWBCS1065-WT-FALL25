During this lab, I learned how to use Git for version control, including adding, committing, and pushing files to a remote repository.  
I practiced creating and updating files, working with branches, and merging changes.  
This helped me understand how Git tracks changes and makes collaboration easier.  
Overall, the lab improved my confidence in using Git and GitHub for managing projects.
